# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Starting the challenge afresh, going to update log in the format below

## Day 0: Thu, December 21 2017,  8:53 PM  

### **Today's Progress**:  
- Started building my website. Made initial commit - basic readme and index.html

- Built initial website, hosted on github. Added old posts (2).

### **Thoughts** 
Its a good effort and a clean start. Going to update it with some basic layout content and see where it goes by end of day.

### **Link(s) to work**
	1. https://brainwave.github.io 

### **Todo Next:**
	1. Customize font faces
	2. Add LinkedIn Profile (To Update)
	3. Add content - Machine Learning 
	4. Add content - Kinect


# Restarting Challenge

Unfortunately, while I was working regularly I forgot to update this log. I'm going to start afresh purely because I wish to document all my work, and then later remove this false start section

## Day 1: Fri, Thursday 28 2017,  2:12 AM  

### **Today's Progress**:  

- Implemented SVM Classifier using sklearn libraries
- Trained it on trashnet dataset
- Performed model predictions
- Create Gist

### **Thoughts** 

- SVM's, while very basic ML, form the building blocks of much more powerful algorithms
- Implementing it was nice - I did it custom first but clearly libraries are much more optimized
- I am yet to explore the other forms, but this is quite enough for implementation

### **Todo Next:**

- Measure accuracy
- Document it on website
